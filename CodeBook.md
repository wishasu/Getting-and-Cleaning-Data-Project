# subject and sctivity

## 1. subject
The thirty subjects Identified by
## 2  activity.name
The six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) that are measured using the gyroscope and accelerometer in the smartphone the subjects were wearing.

# Features - X,Y,Z Measurements
Each mesurement has three values, one for each of the X,Y,Z directions, normalized between -1 an 1. Only the mean and standard deviations for each type of measurement are recorded here.

The names of each feautre are FEATURE.mean...X, FEATURE.mean...Y, and FEATURE.mean...Z
unless stated otherwise. The t before each feature means the time domain, and the f means that is is a fast forier transform of the data(fft) into the frequency domain.
